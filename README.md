## 🌟 About Me
🚀 My aspiration is to become a Full Stack Developer. At the moment, I’m learning the fundamentals of Cloud Computing with Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
💡 I enjoy gaining knowledge by creating simple projects and experimenting with new tools and programming languages. I believe that mistakes and constructive feedback are key to learning and growth.
👨‍💻 I have hands-on experience with programming languages such as C, Python, and Java. I’ve also developed basic websites and mobile applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Android Studio.
🌱 I’m always eager to practice, build new projects, and connect with others in the tech community.
